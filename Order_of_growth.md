#Order Of Growth
A function f(x) is said to be growing faster tha g(x) if
            lim (n->infinite)  f(n)/g(n)  = infinite  OR
            lim (n->infinite)  g(n)/f(n)  = zero 

#direct Way 
1. Ignore lower order forms;
2. Ignore leading constant

(c) < (log(log n)) <(log n) < (n^(1/3)) < (n^(1/2))< (n) < (n^2) < (n^3) <(n^4) <(2^n) < (n^n)
